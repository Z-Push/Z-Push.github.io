										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>after one year of intensive development we have just released Z-Push 2.3.0 final (tag 2.3.0, commit cc7ee228a5b1421268db37a0e1f7f9725ac1ffdf).</p>
<p>There are many new features in Z-Push 2.3.0, like packages and repositories for 14 distributions, MySQL and memcache support for states, improved Outlook compatibility (KOE) and especially: a vast speed improvement!<br />
We would like to thank a lot our community contributors Etienne, Francisco, Nicolas, Ralf and Vincent who helped to make this possible!</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade procedure</strong><br />
You can directly upgrade from any Z-Push 2.2.x.<br />
After the upgrade, &#8220;<em>z-push-admin -a fixstates</em>&#8221; needs to be executed once!<br />
Else the Ping request will not block and devices will sync continuously.<br />
After the fixstates all mobiles will work normally and Ping will be working as expected.<br />
<strong>Read more about the upgrade procedure in our <a href="https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Upgrade+to+Z-Push+2.3">wiki</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We strongly advise you to install the from the packages and don&#8217;t use the tarball (which we also publish)!</strong><br />
<strong>More information about the installation from repositories and packages is available here: <a href="https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Installation">https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Installation</a><br />
</strong><br />
The full change log is available <a href="http://download.z-push.org/final/2.3/z-push-2.3.0.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>Your feedback is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br />
Manfred<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>today we have released the Z-Push 2.2.11 final version (tag 2.2.11, commit 2f61f031c416b7b78c85f02ff86454e394280888). Once again we thank all contributors for their work on this release.</p>
<p><strong>Important notes</strong><br />
This version contains some fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Ping now should catch all notifications when there are shared folders configured.<br />
Calling z-push-top now works from any directory.<br />
There was a bug in handling timezone information which caused some appointments to have wrong time.<br />
When trying to move a message to trash that is not on the server anymore, we now tell the mobile that worked to prevent incompatibilities.<br />
The GetHierarchy() for old ActiveSync versions was fixed. The printwbxml debug script can now be executed from any folder.<br />
Some other improvements.</p>
<p>The full change log is available <a href="http://download.z-push.org/final/2.2/z-push-2.2.11.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>The version is available at: <a href="http://download.z-push.org/final/2.2/">http://download.z-push.org/final/2.2/</a>.</p>
<p>Your feedback is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br />
