										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>with the release of Z-Push 2.0 final on the 21st of June 2012 we have reached a new milestone in the Z-Push development. In this post I would like to share our view regarding Z-Push 1 and what is going to happen with it. We have ceased the development of the new features for Z-Push 1 in order to put our complete effort into Z-Push 2 development. We encourage you to migrate to Z-Push 2 already as it has improved in many aspects and the debugging of issues is also easier for us. We will merge the fixes back into Z-Push 1 where possible and also fix the issues which aren&#8217;t too complex. This complementary support will be available for about 6 months until the 31st of December 2012. Afterwards we will offer upgrade support only.</p>
<p>Greets, Manfred<br />
Z-Push dev team</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>after 1,5 years of development we are happy to announce Z-Push 2.0 final.</p>
<p>Some of the new features:<br />
&#8211; supports ActiveSync version 14, allowing full HTML email synchronization on all capable devices.<br />
&#8211; possibility to set/unset your out-of-office settings on your mobile (not all devices support this feature)<br />
&#8211; &#8220;z-push-top&#8221; tool which shows top-like informations about currently connected devices and their activity<br />
&#8211; a real real-time notification mechanism for the Zarafa Backend (requires ZCP 7.0.6 or higher)<br />
&#8211; performs semantic data checks before sending data to a mobile<br />
&#8211; identifies and fixes or ignores broken items<br />
&#8211; bi-directional and inter process loop detection<br />
&#8211; server side search in emails which are not on the phone<br />
&#8211; meeting organizer sees the status of attendees (accepted/declined/tentatively) on the phone<br />
&#8211; notes synchronization (only available for some clients e.g. Touchdown on Android)<br />
&#8211; heartbeat and partial synchronization support<br />
&#8211; support of recurring tasks (Mantis #125)<br />
&#8211; global synchronization of the Public Folder (Mantis #198)<br />
&#8211; improved logging (loglevels, logs on user level possible)<br />
&#8211; introducing the &#8220;combined&#8221; backend</p>
<p>There is a lot of new code regarding the ActiveSync 14 support. Many synchronization mechanisms have changed.<br />
We also switched our Bugtracker. From this version on all tickets will be found at <a href="http://jira.zarafa.com/browse/ZP">http://jira.zarafa.com/browse/ZP</a>.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everybody who contributed with testing and reporting of issues and ideas<br />
especially Jan aka deHoeninger, Vincent aka liverpoolfcfan, Erwin aka ebogaard,<br />
Uwe aka uwe347, Niels aka nprzybilla, Paul aka pfloor and Bert.<br />
We would also like to thank dw2412 – Andreas Brodowski – for his work on the AS12 branch. A few code blocks of his branch made it into the release.<br />
Apologies and a big thank you if we have forgotten someone.</p>
<p>An updated version of the Mobile Device Management Plugin for the Zarafa Webaccess,<br />
which supports Z-Push 2, was also released.<br />
It has a new feature which allows resynchronisation of the mobile devices.<br />
Please check the Community Hub for more information:<br />
<a href="http://z-push.sf.net/mdmplugin">http://z-push.sf.net/mdmplugin</a></p>
<p>There is no upgrade path for Z-Push 1.x versions, but as this version implements<br />
a fully automatic resynchronizing of devices in the case states are missing or faulty,<br />
you should upgrade _without_ maintaining the existing states.</p>
<p>The state directory is by default /var/lib/z-push, the log directory /var/log/z-push.<br />
Please create these directories and make them writeable for apache or<br />
change the configuration parameters to your needs.</p>
<p>Be aware that if you are using LOGLEVEL_DEBUG and LOGLEVEL_WBXML Z-Push will be quite talkative, so it is advisable to use log-rotate on the log file.</p>
<p>The complete changelog is available at: <a href="http://zarafa-deutschland.de/z-push-download/final/2.0/z-push-2.0-1346.txt">http://zarafa-deutschland.de/z-push-download/final/2.0/z-push-2.0-1346.txt</a>.</p>
<p>The version is available at: <a href="http://z-push.sourceforge.net/download">http://z-push.sourceforge.net/download</a>.</p>
<p>Your feedback is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br />
Manfred<br />
Z-Push dev team</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>we just released Z-Push 2.0 RC (build 1333).</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong><br />
This version fixes issues with Playbook&#8217;s and Androids&#8217; (&gt;=4.0.3) calendar. It also fixes the issue that a forwarded message has been truncated.<br />
The server-side search has been improved as well. The range and the folder in which the search was initiated are taken into account.<br />
Android 4 compatibility has been improved a lot with this release.<br />
Also a lot of other smaller fixes and improvements have been made.</p>
<p><strong>Additional notes</strong><br />
The default state directory is /var/lib/z-push, the default log directory /var/log/z-push.<br />
Please create these directories and make them writable for Apache<br />
or change the configuration parameters to fit your needs.</p>
<p>Be aware that if you are using LOGLEVEL_DEBUG and LOGLEVEL_WBXML Z-Push will be quite talkative,<br />
so it is advisable to use log-rotate on the log file.</p>
<p>The version is available at: <a href="http://z-push.sourceforge.net/download" target="_blank">http://z-push.sourceforge.net/download</a></p>
<p>Your feedback is highly appreciated and requested.</p>
