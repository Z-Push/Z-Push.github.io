It is optimized\r\nfor a ZCP version 7.1.11 or later. The correct functionality with an earlier\r\nZCP version is not guaranteed.\r\n\r\nWe also added chunked folder sync support. It should solve the issue that the\r\nsync with android devices wasn't possible for users with a lot of (several\r\nhundreds) folders. Please read the notes in the config.php for\r\nUSE_PARTIAL_FOLDERSYNC. This feature is disabled per default.\r\n\r\nAlso some minor fixes like appointments with \"working elsewhere\" status weren't\r\nsynced to the mobile device, removed svn executable property from several files.\r\n\r\n<strong>Changes since Z-Push 2.1.3<\/strong>\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n[ZP-42] - Z-Push AutoDiscover\r\n[ZP-543] - Remove svn executable property from files\r\n\r\nZarafa\r\n[ZP-269] - Look for enabled\/disabled z-push feature in ZCP\r\n[ZP-510] - Showing appointment in Outlook as \"working elsewhere\" removes appointment from agenda\r\n[ZP-567] - Cache store and inbox properties for FolderSync\r\n\r\nThe version is available at: <a title=\"http:\/\/download.z-push.org\/final\/2.2\/\" href=\"http:\/\/download.z-push.org\/final\/2.2\/\">http:\/\/download.z-push.org\/final\/2.2\/<\/a>.\r\n\r\nYour feedback is highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nManfred\r\nZ-Push dev team<\/pre>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi all, today we have released the Z-Push 2.2 final version (build 1934).
