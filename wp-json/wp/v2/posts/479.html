For Kopano you require Kopano Core 8.2 which is not yet released as stable.<\/p>\n<p>Z-Push 2.3.2 already contains fixes related to Meeting Requests on iOS. While this fix works, it&#8217;s not backward compatible to ZCP 7.1.x and 7.2.x before 7.2.3 versions.<br \/>\nThis release fixes it also for these older versions.<\/p>\n<p>We did introduce two new configuration options and did some changes in the headers. These will require you to update your configuration files.<\/p>\n<p>This version is required for KOE 1.2 which will released soon. It contains an improved API to open shared folders, also in a hierarchical expected way.<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s now also possible to stop synchronizing hidden GAB objects to the KOE GAB.
