					<div class="entry-content">
					<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>today we have released the final version of Z-Push 2.0.6 (build 1616). There were two fixes after the 2.0.6RC was released, you should update if you are using the RC version. The 2.0.6RC breaks the synchronisation with devices which only support up to ActiveSync version 12.0 (Windows Mobile 6.0). The newer devices (Windows Mobile 6.1 and 6.5, Windows Phone, iOS devices, android devices, recent Symbian phones) aren&#8217;t affected.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong><br />
It fixes duplicate items issues in devices which are Heartbeat-able (Windows Phone, some Android devices). Issue regarding meeting request on Nokia Meego has also been fixed. Windows Mobile 6.1 and 6.5 now are able to synchronize using Z-Push. We have also updated the documentation regarding required packages for various operating systems. Existing with CTRL+C from z-push-top doesn&#8217;t break the terminal any more. We have removed Kolab backend because it is not being developed any more.</p>
<p>Using Zarafa backend it&#8217;s now possible to move folders on iOS devices. Also it&#8217;s not possible any more to delete junk folder or to rename draft or outbox on iOS devices. Rare cases issue that special chars were broken on Android devices has been fixed. &#8220;On event&#8221; reminders set on the phone are now correctly synced to Outlook/Webapp/Webaccess.</p>
<p>Thanks to Franscisco aka fmbiete the IMAP backend users now have HTML email support on their devices. He also implemented stars (todo flags) and added some other fixes to the IMAP backend. Big thanks, Fransciso, and keep up the good work.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank Vincent aka liverpoolfan for his feedback and suggestions and Robert aka rsc for his suggestions and bug reports. And also thanks for everyone for Z-Push feedback.</p>
<p>Complete change log is available at:Â <a href="http://zarafa-deutschland.de/z-push-download/final/2.0/z-push-2.0.6-1616.txt">http://zarafa-deutschland.de/z-push-download/final/2.0/z-push-2.0.6-1616.txt</a></p>
<p>Your feedback is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Manfred<br />
