					<description><![CDATA[Hi Team,
I have installed z-push 2.2.1-1939 and d-push(coming with ubuntu).
I always get the same problems:
1. Large Boxes have some(and every time the same) E-Mails which are not synced from iPhone
2. push was never working also on account with a fully synced box

Server:
Cyrus 2.4
Apache2
I-Phone 4s and 6 plus with iOS 8.3

Actually no tutorial helped.
I don&#039;t know what is wrong. The installation was easy.
The logs give only the hints to the looped mails.
When a Mail is received in cyrus nothing is happen in the logs.

Is it possible to increase the debug level?
Greetings from Germany C.O.]]></description>
