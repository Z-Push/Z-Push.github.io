										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>we have just released <strong>Z-Push 2.4.5 final</strong> (tag <strong>2.4.5</strong> commit <strong>3b937fb5c79068553198347ffad1f39f2e9d1b51</strong>). </p>
<p>This is a maintenance release with some bugfixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Email categories would disappear in Outlook when marking email as read or unread on another client. This issue has been fixed however there might be increased server load as Z-Push now opens the email to load the categories.</p>
<p>We made some changes to Z-Push packaging in order to fix dependencies on Debian 9, logrotate on RHEL 6 and improve performance for installations which use nginx as the webserver.</p>
<p>Using RHEL with Remi PHP 7.x packages and SQL state machine should work now.</p>
<p>Thanks to Nicolas who provided a path to reproduce an issue GAL search bug and a solution how to fix it.</p>
<p>Private items are no longer stripped in own calendar when it&#8217;s configured as shared folder in Z-Push config.</p>
<p>Editing recurring tasks on mobile clients now shouldn&#8217;t break synchronisation.</p>
<p>Install Z-Push 2.4.4 from the final repositories (recommended) <a href="https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Installation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Z-Push Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>The complete changelog is available <a href="https://forum.kopano.io/topic/1874/z-push-2-4-5-final-released" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Code changes since Z-Push 2.4.4: <a href="https://stash.z-hub.io/projects/ZP/repos/z-push/compare/diff?targetBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.4.4&#038;sourceBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.4.5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://stash.z-hub.io/projects/ZP/repos/z-push/compare/diff?targetBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.4.4&#038;sourceBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.4.5</a></p>
<p>Please share your experiences (positive and negative) and give feedback!</p>
<p>Greetings,<br />
Manfred</p>
