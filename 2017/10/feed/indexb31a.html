										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>we have just released <strong>Z-Push 2.4.0 alpha1 (technical preview)</strong> (tag <code>2.4.0.alpha1</code> commit <code>fc9858346a48b0b43278c2598fd0f2a4938147a7</code>) and would like to invite you to try it.</p>
<p>Main feature of this version (so far) is the support of ActiveSync 14.1.<br />
This new ActiveSync version has features which are implemented as stubs, like RightsManagement, but no backend uses this functionality already.</p>
<p>With the Kopano backend the GAB search shows you saved pictures of users on the mobile now for devices which support it (iOS and some Android devices).</p>
<p>This version now also brings configuration packages for NGINX that also supports PHP-FPM.</p>
<p>Some smaller performance improvements.</p>
<p>Complete list of the changes is available <a href="https://forum.kopano.io/topic/727/z-push-2-4-0-alpha1-released" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>In order to try this version, just switch to our develop repository and install/update your server.<br />
More information about installing from repositories is available at the <a href="https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Installation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Z-Push Wiki</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Z-Push 2.4.0 will not be released as tarball anymore.</strong><br />
If using the repositories is not an option, it is possible to check out the code via <code>git</code> and the tag <code>2.4.0.alpha1</code>. More information is available <a href="https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/How+to+get+the+latest+Z-Push+code+from+GIT" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Attention: This is an alpha version and not suitable for production usage by the general public.</strong></p>
<p>Please share your experiences (positive and negative) and give feedback!</p>
<p>Greetings,<br />
Sebastian</p>
