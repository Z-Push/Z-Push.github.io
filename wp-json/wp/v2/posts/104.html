In this post I would like to share our view regarding Z-Push 1 and what is going to happen with it. We have ceased the development of the new features for Z-Push 1 in order to put our complete effort into Z-Push 2 development. We encourage you to migrate to Z-Push 2 already as it has improved in many aspects and the debugging of issues is also easier for us. We will merge the fixes back into Z-Push 1 where possible and also fix the issues which aren&#8217;t too complex. This complementary support will be available for about 6 months until the 31st of December 2012. Afterwards we will offer upgrade support only.<\/p>\n<p>Greets, Manfred<br \/>\nZ-Push dev team<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi all, with the release of Z-Push 2.0 final on the 21st of June 2012 we have reached a new milestone in the Z-Push development.
