<p><strong>Important notes</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Today we have released the Z-Push 2.1.0 final version (build 1750).<br />
It contains several new features like S/Mime support and administration features. Windows 8 ActiveSync is now also supported.<br />
Compared to 2.1.0 Milestone 2 this version has various general fixes, regarding S/Mime, Blackberry 10 and calendaring.</p>
<p>For better performance of Windows 8 mail clients changes in the state files are necessary.<br />
When you upgrade from Z-Push 2.0.x or 2.1.0 M1 you need to migrate your Z-Push states &#8211; see instructions below.</p>
<p>Please report us your experience, about this release in general and please also about the upgrade process.</p>
<p><strong>Important &#8211; NOTE</strong><br />
This version of Z-Push only works with ZCP 7.0.6 or later.</p>
<p><strong>Important &#8211; UPGRADE from Z-Push 2.0.x</strong><br />
The states of Z-Push 2.0.x and 2.1.0 M1 are not compatible, but a state migration script is available in the tools folder.</p>
<p>To upgrade, please follow these steps:<br />
1. Upgrade your z-push files to the new version<br />
2. Restart apache  (important or your upgrade might fail!)<br />
3. Mobiles which connect will receive a temporary synchronization error (only visible if you explicitly click &#8220;refresh&#8221; on the mobiles)<br />
4. Run the upgrade script located in the tools folder. The files distributed by us contain a correct configuration of this script to access the config file and locate the state files. If your file locations are different, please check the path settings in the top of the migration script.<br />
5. After running the migration script, mobiles will continue synchronizing without any re-synchronization</p>
<p>You can run the script multiple times, but normally there is no need to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Changes compared to Z-Push 2.0.x:</strong></p>
<p>New features:<br />
[ZP-36] &#8211; Feature to resynchronize a single folder or folder type of a user<br />
[ZP-43] &#8211; Implement ValidateCert command<br />
[ZP-44] &#8211; Implement ResolveRecipients command<br />
[ZP-45] &#8211; Implement S/Mime<br />
[ZP-237] &#8211; Show if folders are fully synchronized in z-push-admin device details<br />
[ZP-272] &#8211; Command MoveItems should check if messages are in sync interval<br />
[ZP-328] &#8211; Proxied Z-Push could show remote IP instead of proxy IP<br />
[ZP-379] &#8211; Reply/Forward flags are not synced from the server to the mobile</p>
<p>Full change log is available <a href="http://zarafa-deutschland.de/z-push-download/final/2.1/z-push-2.1.0-1750.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>The version is available at: <a href="http://zarafa-deutschland.de/z-push-download/final/2.1/">http://zarafa-deutschland.de/z-push-download/final/2.1/</a>.</p>
<p>Your feedback is highly appreciated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>today we have released the final version Z-Push 2.0.7 (build 1690).</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>In this version we have implemented new features like the support for S/Mime signing and en/decryption of messages on the mobile. Also Reply/Forward flags sync from the server to the mobile was implemented.</p>
<p>We have also merged several fixes from 2.1 into this release. Heartbeat connections should work as expected now and not cause sync on every folder.</p>
<p><strong>S/MIME</strong></p>
<p>The following refers to Zarafa backend only.In order to use S/MIME for email signing and/or encryption on your mobile device there are some requirements.First of all you will need an email certificate. Acquiring it is beyond of the scope of this document. Configuring certifications in AD/LDAP is also not covered here but there are various sites covering it. Later the will be a more extensive configuration manual available.</p>
<p>The private key must be imported to the mobile device. It can be achieved either sending yourself an email with the key or uploading it onto the storage card. The key must be in PKCS-format (.p12). It can be exported e.g. using windows mmc console. It is also possible to retrieve the key using Firefox certificates&#8217; backup (if you have installed the certificate using Firefox). Once you&#8217;ve imported it, in your active sync account settings there&#8217;s security options where you can select the key.</p>
<p>It might be possible that PHP functions require CA information in order to validate certs. Therefore the CAINFO parameter in the line 101 of config.php must be configured propertly.</p>
<p>The public keys for encryption are retrieved either from the global address book or the contacts.</p>
<p>In Active Directory the public key for contacts from GAB is saved in PR_EMS_AB_TAGGED_X509_CERT (0x8C6A1102) property and if you save a key in a contact it&#8217;s PR_USER_X509_CERTIFICATE (0x3A701102).</p>
<p>In LDAP public key for contacts from GAB is saved in userCertificate property. It should be mapped to 0x3A220102 in ldap.propmap.cfg (0x3A220102     =       userCertificate). Make sure it looks like this in LDAP: userCertificate;binary:: MIIFGjCCBAKgAwIBAgIQbRnqpxlPa&#8230;</p>
<p>Currently only Android 4.X and higher and iOS 5 and higher devices are known to support encryption/signing of emails.</p>
<p><strong>Changes</strong> <strong>since 2.0.6</strong></p>
<p>New features:</p>
<p>[ZP-396] &#8211; Merge into 2.0.x: Reply/Forward flags are not synced from the server to the mobile</p>
<p>[ZP-401] &#8211; Merge into 2.0.x: Implement S/MIME</p>
<p>Full change log is available <a href="http://zarafa-deutschland.de/z-push-download/final/2.0/z-push-2.0.7-1690.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>Your feedback is highly appreciated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>today we have released the final version of Z-Push 2.0.6 (build 1616). There were two fixes after the 2.0.6RC was released, you should update if you are using the RC version. The 2.0.6RC breaks the synchronisation with devices which only support up to ActiveSync version 12.0 (Windows Mobile 6.0). The newer devices (Windows Mobile 6.1 and 6.5, Windows Phone, iOS devices, android devices, recent Symbian phones) aren&#8217;t affected.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong><br />
It fixes duplicate items issues in devices which are Heartbeat-able (Windows Phone, some Android devices). Issue regarding meeting request on Nokia Meego has also been fixed. Windows Mobile 6.1 and 6.5 now are able to synchronize using Z-Push. We have also updated the documentation regarding required packages for various operating systems. Existing with CTRL+C from z-push-top doesn&#8217;t break the terminal any more. We have removed Kolab backend because it is not being developed any more.</p>
<p>Using Zarafa backend it&#8217;s now possible to move folders on iOS devices. Also it&#8217;s not possible any more to delete junk folder or to rename draft or outbox on iOS devices. Rare cases issue that special chars were broken on Android devices has been fixed. &#8220;On event&#8221; reminders set on the phone are now correctly synced to Outlook/Webapp/Webaccess.</p>
<p>Thanks to Franscisco aka fmbiete the IMAP backend users now have HTML email support on their devices. He also implemented stars (todo flags) and added some other fixes to the IMAP backend. Big thanks, Fransciso, and keep up the good work.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank Vincent aka liverpoolfan for his feedback and suggestions and Robert aka rsc for his suggestions and bug reports. And also thanks for everyone for Z-Push feedback.</p>
<p>Complete change log is available at: <a href="http://zarafa-deutschland.de/z-push-download/final/2.0/z-push-2.0.6-1616.txt">http://zarafa-deutschland.de/z-push-download/final/2.0/z-push-2.0.6-1616.txt</a></p>
