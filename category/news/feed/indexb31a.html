<p>Hello,</p>



<p>we have just released Z-Push&nbsp;<strong>2.5.0 final</strong>&nbsp;(tag&nbsp;<code>2.5.0</code>&nbsp;commit&nbsp;<code>2c7d40e0322ac3a0b6da9832730ae3986a30f112</code>).</p>



<p>This release includes several new features and improvements as well as bug fixes.</p>



<p>One of the most important improvements for Outlook over ActiveSync and KOE users is the better handling of sync windows when loop detection starts. It will process more items in one requests instead of only one.</p>



<p>Michele added new features in fixing states. It is now possible to fix states for a single user using z-push-admin. It’s also possible to configure more verbose output for fix states. See&nbsp;<a href="https://jira.z-hub.io/browse/ZP-1470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://jira.z-hub.io/browse/ZP-1470</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>



<p>Michele also contributed an improvement for reading state information on high traffic environments (e.g. NFS storage). Make sure to update the main Z-Push config (z-push.conf.php) if you were using FILE_STATE_WRITE_ATTEMPTS or FILE_STATE_WRITE_SLEEP as they were deprecated.</p>



<p>GAB sync script now has an option to define which objects in GAB (users, groups, rooms, equipments) should be synchronised. Make sure to update and configure the config file (gab-sync.conf.php) according to your needs.<br>GAB sync for large GABs (several thousand entries) is now significantly faster. We also fixed the issue that the deleted users were still available in GAB after gab-sync.</p>



<p>In the multi memcached server environment a single device’s data will be saved on one of the memcached servers.</p>



<p>The issue that categories were lost when marking an email read/unread on a shared account has been fixed.</p>



<p>Bart contributed a timezone handling improvement for the caldav backend. Thanks a lot!</p>



<p>Marc contributed a date filter fix in search for IMAP backend. Thanks a lot!</p>



<p>Several other fixes and improvements for Z-Push core as well as the backends.</p>



<p>Install Z-Push 2.5.0 final from the final repositories (recommended)&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Installation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Z-Push Wiki</a>.</p>



<p>Thanks a lot to Z-Push contributors Bart, Dirk, Marc, Matteo, maxxer, Michele! Sorry if I forgot anybody, but nevertheless your contributions are highly appreciated. Also thanks to everybody providing us feedback.</p>



<p>The complete list of changes is available <a href="https://forum.kopano.io/topic/2408/z-push-2-5-0-final-released">here</a>.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>We are planning to do the final release of Z-Push 2.5.0 and therefore the changes in the repositories on the <strong>08.05.2019</strong>. The final repository will then contain Z-Push 2.5.X versions. The old-final will contain Z-Push 2.4.X versions. There will also be changes in the supported distributions, so make sure your repository points to an existing one.</p>
<p>What does it mean to you?<br />If you have set up to use a final repository and are planing to use Z-Push 2.5.0 once it&#8217;s released, no changes are required. There won&#8217;t be builds for Debian 7 and Univention 4.0 distributions anymore, so if you are using one of those, either upgrade to a more recent distribution or change the repository to point to one of the supported distributions.</p>
<p>If you have set up to use a final repository and are planing to continue using Z-Push 2.4 after Z-Push 2.5.0 release, you&#8217;ll have to update your repository to old-final. There won&#8217;t be builds for Debian 7, Univention 4.0 as well as Fedora 23, 24 and 25 distributions anymore, so if you are using one of those, either upgrade to a more recent distribution or change the repository to point to one of the supported distributions. For SUSE there will be openSUSE_Leap_42.3 and openSUSE_Tumbleweed repositories. <strong>We will switch the old-stable to Z-Push 2.4 on the 24.04.2019.</strong></p>
<p>If you have set up to use an old-final repository (currently containing Z-Push 2.3.9) and are planing to continue using it, you&#8217;ll have to disable the repository, so that it&#8217;s not updated anymore. However Z-Push 2.3 has been deprecated on the 30th of June 2018 and we strongly encourage to update to a more recent version.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>we have just released <strong>Z-Push 2.4.5 final</strong> (tag <strong>2.4.5</strong> commit <strong>3b937fb5c79068553198347ffad1f39f2e9d1b51</strong>). </p>
<p>This is a maintenance release with some bugfixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Email categories would disappear in Outlook when marking email as read or unread on another client. This issue has been fixed however there might be increased server load as Z-Push now opens the email to load the categories.</p>
<p>We made some changes to Z-Push packaging in order to fix dependencies on Debian 9, logrotate on RHEL 6 and improve performance for installations which use nginx as the webserver.</p>
<p>Using RHEL with Remi PHP 7.x packages and SQL state machine should work now.</p>
<p>Thanks to Nicolas who provided a path to reproduce an issue GAL search bug and a solution how to fix it.</p>
<p>Private items are no longer stripped in own calendar when it&#8217;s configured as shared folder in Z-Push config.</p>
<p>Editing recurring tasks on mobile clients now shouldn&#8217;t break synchronisation.</p>
<p>Install Z-Push 2.4.4 from the final repositories (recommended) <a href="https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Installation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Z-Push Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>The complete changelog is available <a href="https://forum.kopano.io/topic/1874/z-push-2-4-5-final-released" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Code changes since Z-Push 2.4.4: <a href="https://stash.z-hub.io/projects/ZP/repos/z-push/compare/diff?targetBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.4.4&#038;sourceBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.4.5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://stash.z-hub.io/projects/ZP/repos/z-push/compare/diff?targetBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.4.4&#038;sourceBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.4.5</a></p>

<p>we have just released <strong>Z-Push 2.4.4 final</strong> (tag <strong>2.4.4</strong> commit <strong>fa0c7a7f1b87432a178066cf8869e0032abc03d4</strong>).</p>
<p>This is a maintenance release with some bugfixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Michele has contributed a solution for saving states on environments with high traffic (e.g. file state on NFS storage).

<p>Michele also added a better handling of sending emails when the store is full.</p>
<p>Some Android devices weren&#8217;t able to download attachments. This issue has been fixed.</p>
<p>We also resolved the issue of an occurrence of a recurring event not being deleted in certain cases.</p>
<p>The tracking tab of a meeting with multiple attendees would disappear in webapp when an ActiveSync device is connected. Thanks to Mathias for reporting and providing steps to reproduce this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>we have just released <strong>Z-Push 2.4.3 final</strong> (tag <strong>2.4.3</strong> commit <strong>db9535be7940d0d0c83e1e08de77bd40997398f3</strong>).</p>
<p>This is a maintenance release with some bugfixes and improvements.</p>
<p>This is the first Z-Push release which supports PHP 7.2 (default PHP version in Ubuntu 18.04). If you are running Ubuntu 18.04 or plan to upgrading to this version, you should upgrade to Z-Push 2.4.3.</p>
<p>Several smaller issues which were found by coverity (<a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/z-push" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://scan.coverity.com/projects/z-push</a>). Z-Push has now 0.00 defect density!</p>
<p>We added a new action &#8220;listshares&#8221; to z-push-admin. It will display all open shares on the system per store. Run<br />
<code>z-push-admin -a listshares</code><br />
to display open shares for all stores. Run<br />
<code>z-push-admin -a listshares -o USER</code><br />
to display who opened the shares of this user. Run<br />
<code>z-push-admin -a listshares -f FOLDERID</code><br />
to display who opened this specific folder.</p>
<p>Z-Push has a new contributor, Raoul, who fixed a bug in the IMAP backend. Thanks!</p>
<p>Bart has already made various contributions and in this version he added another improvement to the IMAP backend. </p>
<p>Also thanks to Matt and Markus for reporting an issue with logrotation on RHEL-based systems and a suggestion how to fix it.</p>
