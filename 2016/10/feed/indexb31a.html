										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>today we have released the Z-Push 2.2.13 version (tag 2.2.13, commit 161fe5a83152833ee62fca8f48a799458ccf567b).<br />
Once again we thank all contributors for their work on this release.</p>
<p><strong>Release notes</strong></p>
<p>Meeting requests on iOS<br />
We got reports that with the recently released iOS 10, meeting requests could not be accepted anymore.<br />
It seems that Apple decided to introduce a breaking change (probably since iOS 9.3.x) compromising this functionality.<br />
This version implements a workaround for these devices.</p>
<p>Some other improvements.</p>
<p>The full change log is available <a href="http://download.z-push.org/final/2.2/z-push-2.2.13.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in a detailed overview of the code changes, see <a href="https://stash.z-hub.io/projects/ZP/repos/z-push/compare/diff?targetBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.2.12&#038;sourceBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.2.13">https://stash.z-hub.io/projects/ZP/repos/z-push/compare/diff?targetBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.2.12&#038;sourceBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.2.13</a></p>
<p>The version is available at: <a href="http://download.z-push.org/final/2.2/">http://download.z-push.org/final/2.2/</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>we have just released Z-Push 2.3.2 final (tag 2.3.2, commit f9ac780ee5aadde4b17d04429e90d6d33405fd1a).</p>
<p>This version contains two major changes:<br />
<strong>Meeting requests on iOS</strong><br />
We got reports that with the recently released iOS 10, meeting requests could not be accepted anymore.<br />
It seems that Apple decided to introduce a breaking change (probably since iOS 9.3.x) compromising this functionality.<br />
This version implements a workaround for these devices.</p>
<p><strong>Send-as functionality</strong><br />
Especially the Kopano Outlook Extension users requested a way also to use &#8220;Send-As&#8221; from Outlook.<br />
The required changes for Z-Push are already in this version, but the full feature is still under development for KOE.<br />
It will also be possible to use send-as on a mobile phone, but only if you reply to an email received in a shared folder.<br />
When opening the shared folder on your phone, you can define that all replies should be send-as the owner of the store.<br />
This is fully functional, but currently there is no convinient way to set this up.<br />
This functionality is still disabled by default. Check ticket ZP-908 on instructions how to enable/use this feature.</p>
<p>We would like to thank all our community contributors and everyone who tests Z-Push and provides us feedback. Please continue doing that.</p>
<p>The full changelog is available <a href="http://download.z-push.org/final/2.3/z-push-2.3.2.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>Code changes since Z-Push 2.3.1: <a href="https://stash.z-hub.io/projects/ZP/repos/z-push/compare/diff?targetBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.3.1&#038;sourceBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.3.2">https://stash.z-hub.io/projects/ZP/repos/z-push/compare/diff?targetBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.3.1&#038;sourceBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.3.2</a></p>
