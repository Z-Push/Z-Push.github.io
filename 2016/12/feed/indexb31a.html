										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>we have just released Z-Push 2.3.4 final version (tag 2.3.4, commit cb60b14dacebef1aefba404a1b05810e3b1d27b2).</p>
<p>This version is PHP 7 compatible and introduces many other important changes.<br />
The PHP 7 compatibility is focussed on the main Z-Push code, there can be issues with specific backends or backend functionality.<br />
We would like to thank all our community contributors and everyone who tests Z-Push and provides us feedback. Please continue doing that.</p>
<p><strong>Important notes</strong><br />
The PHP 7 compatibility is focussed on the main Z-Push code, there can be issues with specific backends or backend functionality. For Kopano you require Kopano Core 8.2 which is not yet released as stable.</p>
<p>Z-Push 2.3.2 already contains fixes related to Meeting Requests on iOS. While this fix works, it&#8217;s not backward compatible to ZCP 7.1.x and 7.2.x before 7.2.3 versions.<br />
This release fixes it also for these older versions.</p>
<p>We did introduce two new configuration options and did some changes in the headers. These will require you to update your configuration files.</p>
<p>This version is required for KOE 1.2 which will released soon. It contains an improved API to open shared folders, also in a hierarchical expected way.<br />
It&#8217;s now also possible to stop synchronizing hidden GAB objects to the KOE GAB. See here how to do this: <a href="https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Kopano+OL+Extension#KopanoOLExtension-HiddenGABentries">https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Kopano+OL+Extension#KopanoOLExtension-HiddenGABentries</a></p>
<p>The full changelog is available <a href="http://download.z-push.org/final/2.3/z-push-2.3.4.txt">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>today we have released the Z-Push 2.2.14 final version (tag 2.2.14, commit e2c399567fdbdaa8775457667b371559eda4d7ff).<br />
Once again we thank all contributors for their work on this release.</p>
<p><strong>Release notes</strong><br />
This is the last release of the Z-Push 2.2.x series. From 2017 on we will give only upgrade support for these versions.<br />
Details can be found on: <a href="https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Version+lifecycle">https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Version+lifecycle</a></p>
<p><strong>Meeting requests on iOS</strong><br />
Z-Push 2.2.13 already contains fixes related to Meeting Requests on iOS. While this fix works, it&#8217;s not backward compatible to ZCP 7.1.x and 7.2.x before 7.2.3 versions.<br />
This release fixes it also for these older versions.</p>
<p><strong>Outlook over ActiveSync</strong><br />
If you use (or want to use) Outlook over ActiveSync with Z-Push this will not work with this version anymore.<br />
We decided to block Outlook access, because of many issues that are solved in Z-Push 2.3.<br />
If you want to use Outlook, please upgrade to the latest Z-Push 2.3 version.<br />
Upgrade information can be found here: <a href="https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Upgrade+to+Z-Push+2.3">https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Upgrade+to+Z-Push+2.3</a></p>
<p>In this final release we also added the WebserviceInfo->About() call which allows WebApp (or other system using Z-Push Webservices) to display Z-Push version.</p>
<p>The full change log is available <a href="http://download.z-push.org/final/2.2/z-push-2.2.14.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in a detailed overview of the code changes, see <a href="https://stash.z-hub.io/projects/ZP/repos/z-push/compare/diff?targetBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.2.13&#038;sourceBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.2.14">https://stash.z-hub.io/projects/ZP/repos/z-push/compare/diff?targetBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.2.13&#038;sourceBranch=refs%2Ftags%2F2.2.14</a></p>
