Best option: Use a provided script to list all users with shared calendars and resynchronize them from the server.<br \/>\nThe script is available here: <a href=\"https:\/\/stash.z-hub.io\/projects\/ZP\/repos\/z-push\/browse\/tools\/list-shared-folders.php\">https:\/\/stash.z-hub.io\/projects\/ZP\/repos\/z-push\/browse\/tools\/list-shared-folders.php<\/a><br \/>\nUsage instructions can be found within the file (line 50).<br \/>\n2. Easy but with overhead: Resynchronize all calendars using &#8220;z-push-admin -a resync -t calendar&#8221;. This will cause all calendars from all users to be resynchronized.<br \/>\nThis could be a lot of overhead and produce high load on your server (for many users\/calendars). Prefer option 1!<br \/>\n3. Manual fix: Ask the users to close and reopen the shared calendar in Outlook.<\/p>\n<p>We would like to thank all our community contributors and everyone who tests Z-Push and provides us feedback.
