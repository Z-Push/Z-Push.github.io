Please update your config accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Synchronization of private appointments<\/strong><br \/>\nPrivate appointments are now not being ignored in shared folders anymore. During the synchronization process their data is stripped, which means that private appointments show up in a shared folder, but have no sensitive data. It\u2019s not possible to edit (save) these appointments via shared access.<br \/>\nOlder KOE versions will allow editing these in Outlook, but the data will not be saved on the server.<br \/>\nCalendars that are already shared need to be re-synchronized in order to see existing private appointments (close &#038; re-open shared calendar).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Prioritization of the KOE GAB<\/strong><br \/>\nAll KOE versions will benefit from the prioritization of the KOE GAB. Until now it could happen that the GAB was only available at the end of the synchronization. This will now happen early in the synchronization process.<\/p>\n<p><strong>KOE 1.4<\/strong><br \/>\nPlease be aware that for many of the new features you need KOE 1.4, the release candidate (RC) can be found here: <a href=\"https:\/\/kopano.com\/kopano-ol-extension-1-4-rc-now-available\/\">https:\/\/kopano.com\/kopano-ol-extension-1-4-rc-now-available\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>There have also been some contributions from Chris (IPv6 logging) and Vincent (loosen SyncObject.equals) in this version.
