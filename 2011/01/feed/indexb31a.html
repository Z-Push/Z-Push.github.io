										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 13/01/2011 we have released the final version of Z-Push 1.5.</p>
<p>This version introduces several innovations to Z-Push.<br />
New backends were added, libraries were updated, logging was improved, PEAR dependency removed, configurable state directory, improved results from GAL search and many more. The full changelog is available <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/project/shownotes.php?release_id=18234" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong> When upgrading from a version before 1.5 you MUST adjust the &#8220;state-directory&#8221; setting in the config.php file, or your mobile will go out of sync!<br />
If you want to make use of the possibility to store the states in a folder outside of Z-Push, make sure you copy or move the old states to the new location before connecting with a mobile.</p>
<p>Download at: <a href="http://z-push.sourceforge.net/download">http://z-push.sourceforge.net/download</a></p>
<p>Greetings, Sebastian<br />
Z-Push dev team</p>
