This version fixed and improved some issues with the handling of signed emails on Zarafa backend. We would really appreciate your feedback on this matter.<br />
Also some issues with the WBXML processing were fixed.<br />

It is now possible to delete the hierarchy cache using z-push-admin.<br />
We made some enhancements to listfolders.php, it will now display the Inbox and Sent Items ids.</p>
