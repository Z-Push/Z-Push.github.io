However Z-Push 2.3 has been deprecated on the 30th of June 2018 and we strongly encourage to update to a more recent version.<\/p>\n<p>Manfred<br \/>Z-Push developer<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;3.22.3&#8243;][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;3.22.3&#8243;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;3.22.3&#8243;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;3.22.3&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;3px|||||&#8221;] We are planning to do the final release of Z-Push 2.5.0 and therefore the changes in the repositories on the 08.05.2019.
