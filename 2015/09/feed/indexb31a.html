<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>2015-10-19: We had to take this version offline as it introduced a bug in all backends (ZP-723). We will release a Z-Push 2.2.5 which will include a fix for it and changes from 2.2.4 today.</strong></span></h3>
<p>today we have released the Z-Push 2.2.4 final version (tag 2.2.4, commit fecec66ca6a266e526efe7304e2823e822d31882). We had to remove ZP-672 from the final release because it has caused problems with GAL search.</p>
<p><strong>Important notes</strong><br />
This version contains quite some bug fixes and improvements, most of them being the contributions from the community. Thanks a lot to Francisco, Ralf and Vincent.<br />
Outlook with ActiveSync was working slow or not at all in certain cases due to Global WindowsSize not being honoured.<br />
Adjustments to make Z-Push work with PHP-Composer.<br />
Functionality to auto load backend was added.<br />
There were improvements for the DiffBackend performance.<br />
Z-Push logs and legal message now display the git commit information.</p>
<p>The full changelog is available <a href="http://download.z-push.org/final/2.2/z-push-2.2.4.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>The version is available at: <a href="http://download.z-push.org/final/2.2/">http://download.z-push.org/final/2.2/</a>.</p>
<p>Your feedback is highly appreciated.</p>
