										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>we don&#8217;t usually publish news on alpha or beta releases, but it is a big step in Z-Push development and we thought it was worth it.</p>
<p>After more than one year of intensive development, we just released Z-Push 2.3.0 alpha2 (tag 2.3.0alpha2, commit 595d6f2394cd81040f20d8aaf93a7c45e4ed7b7b).<br />
There are many new features, like Z-Push packages and repositories, MySQL and memcache support for states, improved Outlook compatibility (KOE) and especially: a vast speed improvement!<br />
We would like to thank a lot our community contributors Etienne, Francisco, Nicolas, Ralf and Vincent who helped to make this possible!</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade procedure</strong><br />
You can directly upgrade from any Z-Push 2.2.x. <strong>After the upgrade, &#8220;z-push-admin -a fixstates&#8221; needs to be executed once!</strong> Else the Ping request will not block and devices will sync continuously.<br />
After the fixstates all mobiles will work normally and Ping will be blocking as expected.</p>
<p><strong>This version introduces new features that are partially not downgradable.</strong> A limited downgrade is possible.<br />
In order to use all new features (especially for Outlook users) existing profiles must be completely re-synchronized, e.g. via &#8220;z-push-admin -a resync -u username&#8221;.<br />
After the resync the devices use a new type of folderids (short ids) which are not compatible with Z-Push 2.2.x anymore.<br />
Re-synchronized profiles or newly connected devices (after the upgrade to 2.3.0) will not work properly when downgrading to Z-Push 2.2.x. These devices will be re-synchronized again automatically.<br />
There is no need to perform the resync immediately. Profiles created with 2.2.x will work normally with 2.3.0, but not all new features will be available.</p>
<p><strong>Blackberry 10 users</strong>: our tests have shown that a server side resync as described here is not enough for BB10 devices to work reliably. You need to remove and re-create the profile on these devices.<br />
BB seems to cache old folderids which causes sync inconsistencies. Ideally: (1) remove profile from BB (2) remove state on server (3) create the profile on the BB again.<br />
Existing Blackberry profiles will work normally with 2.3.0, but at some point they should be re-synchronized &amp; recreated.</p>
<p>The z-push tarball is available normally, but we encourage you to use the z-push repositories and packages.<br />
More information about the installation from repositories and packages is available here: <a href="https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Installation">https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/ZP/Installation</a></p>
<p>The full changelog is available at: <a href="http://download.z-push.org/beta/2.3/z-push-2.3.0-alpha2.txt">http://download.z-push.org/beta/2.3/z-push-2.3.0-alpha2.txt</a></p>
<p>You can download the Z-Push 2.3.0 alpha2 tarball here: <a href="http://download.z-push.org/beta/2.3/">http://download.z-push.org/beta/2.3/</a></p>
