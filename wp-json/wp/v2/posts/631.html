It will process more items in one requests instead of only one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michele added new features in fixing states. It is now possible to fix states for a single user using z-push-admin. It\u2019s also possible to configure more verbose output for fix states. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/jira.z-hub.io\/browse\/ZP-1470\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/jira.z-hub.io\/browse\/ZP-1470<\/a>&nbsp;for more information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michele also contributed an improvement for reading state information on high traffic environments (e.g. NFS storage). Make sure to update the main Z-Push config (z-push.conf.php) if you were using FILE_STATE_WRITE_ATTEMPTS or FILE_STATE_WRITE_SLEEP as they were deprecated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GAB sync script now has an option to define which objects in GAB (users, groups, rooms, equipments) should be synchronised. Make sure to update and configure the config file (gab-sync.conf.php) according to your needs.<br>GAB sync for large GABs (several thousand entries) is now significantly faster. We also fixed the issue that the deleted users were still available in GAB after gab-sync.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the multi memcached server environment a single device\u2019s data will be saved on one of the memcached servers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue that categories were lost when marking an email read\/unread on a shared account has been fixed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bart contributed a timezone handling improvement for the caldav backend. Thanks a lot!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marc contributed a date filter fix in search for IMAP backend. Thanks a lot!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several other fixes and improvements for Z-Push core as well as the backends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Install Z-Push 2.5.0 final from the final repositories (recommended)&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.z-hub.io\/display\/ZP\/Installation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Z-Push Wiki<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks a lot to Z-Push contributors Bart, Dirk, Marc, Matteo, maxxer, Michele!
