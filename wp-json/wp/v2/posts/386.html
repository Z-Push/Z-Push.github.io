These devices will be re-synchronized again automatically.<br \/>\nThere is no need to perform the resync immediately. Profiles created with 2.2.x will work normally with 2.3.0, but not all new features will be available.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Blackberry 10 users<\/strong>: our tests have shown that a server side resync as described here is not enough for BB10 devices to work reliably. You need to remove and re-create the profile on these devices.<br \/>\nBB seems to cache old folderids which causes sync inconsistencies. Ideally: (1) remove profile from BB (2) remove state on server (3) create the profile on the BB again.<br \/>\nExisting Blackberry profiles will work normally with 2.3.0, but at some point they should be re-synchronized &amp; recreated.<\/p>\n<p>The z-push tarball is available normally, but we encourage you to use the z-push repositories and packages.<br \/>\nMore information about the installation from repositories and packages is available here: <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.z-hub.io\/display\/ZP\/Installation\">https:\/\/wiki.z-hub.io\/display\/ZP\/Installation<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The full changelog is available at: <a href=\"http:\/\/download.z-push.org\/beta\/2.3\/z-push-2.3.0-alpha2.txt\">http:\/\/download.z-push.org\/beta\/2.3\/z-push-2.3.0-alpha2.txt<\/a><\/p>\n<p>You can download the Z-Push 2.3.0 alpha2 tarball here: <a href=\"http:\/\/download.z-push.org\/beta\/2.3\/\">http:\/\/download.z-push.org\/beta\/2.3\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Please share your experiences and give feedback!<\/p>\n<p>Greetings,<br \/>\nSebastian<br \/>\nZ-Push dev team<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi all, we don&#8217;t usually publish news on alpha or beta releases, but it is a big step in Z-Push development and we thought it was worth it.
